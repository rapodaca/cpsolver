		Student Sectioning: Reservations.
		<br>
		<br>
		Few notes:
		<ul>
			<li>All reservations are set on instructional offerings and may either have a finite limit or be unlimited.</li>
			<li>A reservation may also restrict what configurations and sections can be used (multiple configurations / sections are possible)</li>
			<li>Reservations may have different priorities, higher priority reservations take precedence.</li>
			<li>Only one reservation is associated with an enrollment
				<ul>
					<li>This means, that at most one reservation will count towards each student course enrollment</li>
					<li>The reservation with highest priority is taken first, then more restrictive (if matching), then more available, then reservation id</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>It is possible not to use reservation, if there is enough space in the course / configuration / sections
				<ul>
					<li>Such assignments have lower weight than if reservation is used (+1 on course alternativity)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Strategy for course / section reservations: do not allow students over the reserved available space into the course / section,
				i.e., do not block students with reservation from having a choice</li>
		</ul>
