		Random Placement Problem.
		<br>
		<br>
		The random placement problem (RPP; for more details, see
		<a href='http://www.fi.muni.cz/~hanka/rpp/'>http://www.fi.muni.cz/~hanka/rpp</a>)
		seeks to place a set of randomly generated rectangles (called objects)
		of different sizes into a larger rectangle (called placement area) in
		such a way that no objects overlap and all objects' borders are
		parallel to the border of the placement area. In addition, a set of
		allowable placements can be randomly generated for each object. The
		ratio between the total area of all objects and the size of the
		placement area will be denoted as the filled area ratio.
		<br>
		<br>
		RPP allows us to generate various instances of the problem similar to
		a trivial timetabling problem. The correspondence is as follows: the
		object corresponds to a course to be timetabled; the x-coordinate to
		its time, the y-coordinate to its classroom. For example, a course
		taking three hours corresponds to an object with dimensions 3x1 (the
		course should be taught in one classroom only). Each course can be
		placed only in a classroom of sufficient capacity; we can expect that
		the classrooms are ordered increasingly in their size so each object
		will have a lower bound on its y-coordinate.

		MPP instances were generated as follows: First, the initial solution
		was computed. The changed problem differs from the initial problem by
		input perturbations. An input perturbation means that both x
		coordinate and y coordinate of a rectangle must differ from the
		initial values, i.e., x!=xinitial and y!=yinitial. For a single initial
		problem and for a given number of input perturbations, we can randomly
		generate various changed problems. In particular, for a given number
		of input perturbations, we randomly select a set of objects which
		should have input perturbations. The solution to MPP can be evaluated
		by the number of additional perturbations. They are given by
		subtraction of the final number of perturbations and the number of
		input perturbations.
